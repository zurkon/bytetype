# bytetype
A Space Shooter game for Typing Practices built with [`Godot`](https://godotengine.org/)

## Description

This project was inspired by the typing game [`ZType`](https://zty.pe/).
Visual inspiration from [`BYTEPATH`](https://github.com/a327ex/BYTEPATH).

It was a good oportunity to practice shaders and deploying games for Web.
Speaking of it, you can play it on your browser.

It can be played on Smartphones too! Not the best experience yet but it was a good proof of concept.
